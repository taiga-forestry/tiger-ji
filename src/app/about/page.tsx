              Outside of my academic and professional endeavors, you&apos;ll most likely find me
              playing violin with an orchestra or small ensemble, spinning all over the floor with
              other bboys, or playing pickup basketball on any court I can find. I also love
              exploring a city&apos;s culinary scene, photographing nature, and playing word games
              like Word Hunt or anything on the New York Times Games site.
